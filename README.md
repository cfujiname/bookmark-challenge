## User story 1

```
As a user
So I can access websites quickly
I want to see a complete list of my bookmarks
```

1. Start with testing features for the simplest thing possible
  - think: what do I expect to be shown in what route?
  - create the simplest feature test to show 'hello world in the main route '/'
  - create index.erb file with 'hello world' to be shown
  - append this route to app.rb, so the server can show
  - run the server 
  - run rspec

2. Then start testing how to show all bookmarks
  - create /bookmarks route
  - append the route to app.rb
  - create a view file to be shown in the route /bookmarks
  - create feature test this route
  - create unit test for this route for #all method
  - implement the code according to rspec results
    - think: the #all method can be solely a class method, calling self.all in the model
